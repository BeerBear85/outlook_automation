Subject: Request to shift meeting start time to :05

Dear {ORGANIZER},

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding our upcoming meeting:

Meeting: {SUBJECT}
Current Start Time: {START_TIME}

Would it be possible to shift the meeting start time by 5 minutes to {NEW_START_TIME}? This small adjustment would help create a buffer between back-to-back meetings and allow for better preparation time.

If this change works for you and other attendees, I would greatly appreciate it. If the current time is critical, please feel free to keep it as scheduled.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards
